# xml
eXtensible MarkUp Language code

XML is a DDL/Data Description Language.  
It is very good at categorising data...;  
because it allows one to both invent/and, name your 'own' tags...;  
to find whatever is your own specific needs.  

For example, let us say you wanted to create a phonebook application;  
then, you could invent your own root-tag called: phonebook.  

&lt;phonebook&gt;
-(the rest of your XML tags goes inside here...)-
&lt;/phonebook&gt;

-(**NOTE**: According to strict XML rules...; there can only be just 'one' root tag pair.)-
