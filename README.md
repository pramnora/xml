# xml
eXtensible MarkUp Language code

XML is a DDL/Data Description Language.  
It is very good at categorising data...;  
because it allows one to both invent/and, name your 'own' tags...;  
to find whatever is your own specific needs.  

For example, let us say you wanted to create a 'phonebook' application;  
then, you could invent your own root-tag called: phonebook.  

&lt;phonebook&gt;  
-(the rest of your XML tags goes inside here...)-  
&lt;/phonebook&gt;  

XML, uses very 'strict' rules...;   
- all paired tags needs to be closed, properly, with a forwards facing slash;    
- each single tag needs to be closed, properly, with a forwards facing slash;     
- there can only be just 'one' root tag pair;  
- etc.
